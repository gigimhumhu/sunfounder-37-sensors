# Blink
Blink is an Arduino sketch to demonstrate the basic functionality of the Keyes RGB LED.

**Model** - Arduino Uno
**Sensor** - Keyes RGB LED

## Wiring Instructions

(Using a solderless breadboard with a labeled grid like [the one seen here](http://www.amazon.com/Solderless-Plug--BreadBoard-tie-points-200PTS/dp/B005GYATUG).)
